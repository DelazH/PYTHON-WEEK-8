# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

## Description  
This project analyzes global COVID-19 data to track cases, deaths, and recoveries. It visualizes trends over time and compares metrics across countries. Built as part of the Python Development Module, this project demonstrates data fetching, cleaning, and visualization using Python.

## Objectives  
- Fetch and parse real-time COVID-19 data from a public API.  
- Clean and structure the data for analysis.  
- Visualize key metrics (cases, deaths, recovery rates) using charts.  
- Compare trends across countries and regions.  

## Tools & Libraries Used  
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Creating visualizations.  
- **Requests**: Fetching data from the COVID-19 API.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and reporting.
